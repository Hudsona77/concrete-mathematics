# Concrete Mathematics — Solutions & Notes

This repository is where I’m grinding through my solutions, proofs, and notes for **_Concrete Mathematics_** by Graham, Knuth, and Patashnik. The book does not hold your hand. It politely hands you a shovel and gestures toward a mountain. Working through it has become part discipline, part curiosity, and part sanctification of the mathematical mind.

The goals here:
- Develop clear, correct, well-motivated solutions.
- Keep the reasoning visible instead of pretending answers appear by revelation.
- Collect identities and tricks that make future problems slightly less humbling.
- Build intuition that transfers to real CS work instead of living only on paper.

This is my way of staying honest: if I claim I want deep foundations, then I’d better do the work.

## Structure

Each chapter has its own directory:
- `chapter-01/`
- `chapter-02/`
- …
- `chapter-09/`

Inside each chapter:
- `solutions/` — worked problems, derivations, and the occasional “I wrestled with this one longer than Jacob with the angel” moment.

More directories may appear as needed (notes, scratch, sanity checks).

## Notes

This is not an official solution manual.  
It’s a personal workshop. Some proofs will get refactored, corrected, or resurrected after I realize what I wrote at 1am was… not inspired.
